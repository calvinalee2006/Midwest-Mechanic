    <h1>"Who got me to this point?"</h1>
<p>     Life is surrounded by the five W's in life. Some get their questions anwered quickly and some will be waiting for those answers until they
    hit the grave. "Who got me to this point?" is a normal  question people will have and soon they start rambling like they just won an Oscar.
    People with religious beliefs start off by saying "I would like to thank God, for getting me to this point in my life." so on and so-fourth. 
    Where others start off by naming important people in their lives, mom, dad, sister, brother, dog, cat etc.<br>   
        To properly start this off, if I was to answer this question for myself, I would have to say it would be a toss up between God and the old
    fasioned ways of my father. I knew what I wanted out of high school, and thought that my decision would be supported and a couple of years after collage,
    I would fall into the American dream of having a degree, a family, a home a career, and be financially stable. But sadly the whole hearted belief of "A man should have a trade" 
    caught up to me and my fate was decided by a rush decision and thats how I started my journey into the automotive world.
